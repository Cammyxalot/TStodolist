# Todo list with typescript


## Features i want to create:

### Three columns for each stage of tasks:
#### "To do", "Stared", "Finished"
#### Thoses tasks could be mooved to a column to another by a drag and drops feature that i will create myself (no lib' then).

### Drag and drops for tasks as said before.

### Research features in case you have a lot of tasks.

### Filtering features using simple algorithm to sort the tasks.

### Saving the todos.
#### For the moment i aim to use LocalStorage for u to use the List as soon as possible and keeping it simple.

## The stack:
#### React
#### Typescript template
#### Styled Components with types
